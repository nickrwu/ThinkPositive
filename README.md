## Think+ (Think Positive)

Think+ is an iOS App to help desensitize anxiety and trauma. Using EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing), Think+ is just one method to help treat traumatic memories or stressful thoughts.


Use Think+ to change the processing of troubling thoughts or memories. 
Before each session, analyze the negative thoughts felt and pick the corresponding positive emotions that they need to be changed into. Throughout your session, work on thinking about the traumatic or stressful thoughts
and reprocess them into positive thinking.
